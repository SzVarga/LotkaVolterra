## LotkaVolterra

This gui application is a numerical solver of the famous Lotka-Volterra equation given by $$ \begin{align*} \frac{dx}{dt} &= \alpha x - \beta xy, \\ \frac{dy}{dt} &= \delta xy - \gamma y. \end{align*} $$.
The user can choose between the exlpicit or implicit euler methods, set the initial condition as well as parametrize the above model. The result is then plotted in time domain. The use can switch between time series data and the corresponding phase plot.
